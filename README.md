# "A project devoted to evaluating customer service strategies"

#Project Goal:
The goal of Customer_Satisfaction_AI is to evaluate and improve customer service strategies using AI-driven analysis. By leveraging machine learning and deep learning techniques, this project analyzes customer feedback, surveys, and interaction data to generate actionable insights for optimizing customer service operations and increasing satisfaction.

#Technologies Used:

Machine Learning Frameworks: TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn
Data Preprocessing: Pandas, NumPy
Data Storage & Management: SQL (SQLite for local databases)
Model Training & Evaluation: TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn
Visualization & Reporting: Matplotlib, Seaborn
Natural Language Processing: SpaCy, NLTK for text data analysis
Deployment: FastAPI for API serving, Docker for containerization
Implementation Details:

# Data Collection & Preprocessing:
The data includes customer feedback from surveys, emails, and chat logs. Preprocessing steps include data cleaning, normalization, and converting textual data into numerical formats using techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings.

# Feature Engineering:
Features are derived from customer service interactions, including sentiment analysis of texts, interaction duration, and frequency of follow-up actions.

# Model Development:
A variety of machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, Logistic Regression) and deep learning models (e.g., Neural Networks, CNNs) are trained on the data to predict customer satisfaction and classify service quality.

# odel Evaluation:
Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC are used to assess model performance.

# Visualization:
Data visualizations are created to display key metrics, customer satisfaction trends, and model performance.

# Deployment:
The model is deployed via a web interface (using FastAPI or Flask) to allow real-time predictions of customer satisfaction based on new data, such as customer service chat logs.

# Impact/Results:

Improved Customer Service: By accurately predicting customer satisfaction, businesses can focus on improving their customer service operations.
Optimized Resource Allocation: Identifies areas where resources (staff, time, etc.) can be better allocated for higher satisfaction.
Data-Driven Decisions: Provides data-backed insights for managers to make strategic decisions regarding customer service improvements.
Increased Customer Retention: Identifying and addressing the root causes of dissatisfaction can lead to improved customer loyalty.
